# Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Charter

## Goals of the project

- To continue to make the Australian Government Design System the best design system for government.
- To provide permanent ongoing management of and support for Australian Government Design System, ensuring it will remain a viable solution for existing and future users.
- To provide a centralised place for framework adaptations and tooling for Australian Government Design System.

## Principles

1. [Start with user needs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#start-with-user-needs)
2. [Do less](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#do-less)
3. [Design with data](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#design-with-data)
4. [Do the hard work to make it simple](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#do-the-hard-work-to-make-it-simple)
5. [Iterate. Then iterate again](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#iterate-then-iterate-again)
6. [This is for everyone](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#this-is-for-everyone)
7. [Understand context](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#understand-context)
8. [Build digital services, not websites](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#build-digital-services-not-websites)
9. [Be consistent, not uniform](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#be-consistent-not-uniform)
10. [Make things open: it makes things better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better)
 
We have chosen to adapt our principles from [the Gov UK, Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles) and the [Australian Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria), these guidelines have been iterated on since 2012 and provide a solid foundation for delivering government service.

## Responsibilities of TSC

- Technical development
- Design curation
- Setting release dates
- Release quality standards
- Technical direction
- Project governance and process
- GitHub repository hosting and npm publishing
- [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) enforcement
- Development process and any coding standards
- Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators and TSC projects
- Changes to this Charter
- Maintain a list of all TSC members in the README.md
- Curation of RFCs

## Make up of TSC

The make up of TSC should be a diverse and multidisciplinary group:

- Include a diverse multidisciplinary team (developers, designers, accessibility experts, others)
- Include people from government entities
- Include experts from the private sector as volunteer advisors

## Becoming a member of TSC

Interest to join TSC to become a Maintainer, should be forwarded to maintainers@designsystemau.org. Please include information about your experience with the system and why you would like to join this group.

Anyone, with any level of experience can become a Maintainer.

Inactivity in TSC may result in Maintainer status being revoked.

## Losing membership of TSC

Reasons one might lose their membership in this group:

- Violation of the [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
- Extended absence from the project, including not attending meetings
- Ineffectiveness in the role

## TSC meetings

The TSC can be called to meet to discuss matters around:

- TSC membership issues
- Changes to this Charter
- New initiatives or working groups
- Planning for major milestones

The meetings should be infrequent and only be necessary when urgent. Attendance is critical hence scheduling is hard. Expectation is that meetings may be held at most every 2 months.

## RFC process

The process of making changes to the Australian Government Design System follows the common Request for Comments (RFC) process.

See [RFC Readme](https://github.com/designsystemau/RFCs/blob/main/README.md).
